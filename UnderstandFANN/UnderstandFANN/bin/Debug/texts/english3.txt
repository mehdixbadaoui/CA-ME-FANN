I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh
