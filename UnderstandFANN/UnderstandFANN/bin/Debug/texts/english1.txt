Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said ,"You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me 'bout a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine
I ain't misbehaving, I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'd give it all to you
Make me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have been
If you hadn't been a friend of mine
Hey
I haven't seen around since high school (high school)
How you doing, do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Now I see (now I see)
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eyes are trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
(That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my)
